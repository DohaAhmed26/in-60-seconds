The data include latitude and longitude information about each neighborhood. It also includes information about venues such as restaurants, cafes, bars, pizza places, grocery stores, parks or gyms. The dataset could help in gaining information about common places.

The New York City data was cleaned to focus only on Manhattan which resulted on focusing on 40 neighborhood. One hot encoding was applied in order to apply k-means clustering algorithm.
